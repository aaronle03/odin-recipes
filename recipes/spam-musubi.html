        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_musubi"> <em>Spam Musubi</em></a> is a popular snack in Hawaii. It is a type of sushi that features marinated cooked Spam. I got this recipe from a local Hawaiian friend when I was living there.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) container fully cooked luncheon meat (such as Spam)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>5 sheets sushi nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
            <p>Soak uncooked rice in water to cover for 4 hours; drain and rinse.</p>
            <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
            <p>Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</p>
            <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
            <p>Remove pan from heat and stir in rice vinegar. Set aside to cool.</p>
            <li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>
            <p>Stir together sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce in a medium bowl until sugar is completely dissolved. Slice luncheon meat lengthwise into 10 slices, or to desired thickness, and marinate in sauce for 5 minutes.</p>
            <li><h3>Step 5</h3></li>
            <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook slices until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.</p>
            <li><h3>Step 6</h3></li>
            <p>Cut nori sheets in half and lay on a flat work surface. Place a rice press in the center of a sheet, and press rice tightly inside. Top with a slice of luncheon meat, and remove press. Wrap nori around rice, sealing edges with a small amount of water. (Rice may also be formed by hand in the shape of the meat slices and about 1-inch thick.)</p>
            <li><h3>Step 7</h3></li>
            <p>Serve musubi warm or chilled</p>
        </ol>
