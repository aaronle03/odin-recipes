# My Very First SOLO HTML Project - 6/30/2022

I'm planning on making a very bare-bones recipe link website that allows me to find various recipes, etc. 

I'm mostly going to be using my skills of basic headers, links, bolding, etc. As well, creating this website will continue to strengthen my usages of VM and Git!
